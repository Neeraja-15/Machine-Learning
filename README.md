# Machine Learning Project

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at solving [Problem Description]. The goal is to apply machine learning techniques to predict/identify/analyze [specific goal]. The project uses a variety of algorithms and models, including [list of algorithms/models used].

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset(s) used in the project.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with code and exploration.
- `src/`: Python scripts for model training, preprocessing, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Requirements

To set up the project, make sure you have Python 3.x installed and use the following command to install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is [Dataset Name/Source]. It contains [brief description of the data]. You can download it from [link or location of the data].

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the notebook:

You can start exploring the project by opening the Jupyter notebook in the `notebooks/` folder.

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Alternatively, you can run the Python scripts in `src/` for model training and evaluation.
